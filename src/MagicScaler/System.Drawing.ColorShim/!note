This folder contains copies of classes that are included in recent in-box versions of the following assemblies
but missing from their NuGet-distributed equivalents for older runtimes:
	System.Drawing.Primitives
	System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter

They are copied here temporarily from the corefx repo until the older netcoreapp and netstandard versions
that need them are no longer supported.

See:
